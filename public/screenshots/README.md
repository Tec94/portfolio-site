# Project Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots for the project cards displayed on the portfolio website.

## Required Screenshots

Please add the following screenshot files to this directory:

1. `credify.png` - Screenshot of the Credify project
2. `citizenvoice.png` - Screenshot of the CitizenVoice project
3. `smartnest.png` - Screenshot of the Smartnest project
4. `stock-tracker.png` - Screenshot of the Stock Tracker project
5. `munky.png` - Screenshot of the $Munky project

## Recommendations

- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Dimensions**: Recommended minimum width of 1200px for best quality
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or similar landscape orientation works best
- **Content**: Capture the main landing page or most representative view of each project
- **Quality**: Use high-quality screenshots with clear, readable text

## How It Works

The screenshots will automatically display in the project cards on the website. If a screenshot is not available, the system will fall back to showing an iframe preview of the live website.
